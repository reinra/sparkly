# Sparkly

LED controller for [Twinkly](https://www.twinkly.com/) smart LED devices. Control effects, brightness, and colors through a web interface served from a single executable.

## Background

This is a pet project I have created during free time to play with my LED lights at home.
From the original [Twinkly mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twinkly/id1132187056) I was missing:

1. Selection of effects in general.
2. 1D effects for LED strips which work on the level of individual LEDs.
3. Long effects which might not fit on the device memory.
4. Freedom to choose colors randomly.
5. Adjust for 100+100 strips so it looks natural (reverse one branch) without using 2D mapping.

## Current State

> **Beta** — Mostly stable but may have bugs. Future versions may break compatibility.

### Features

#### Standalone App
- **Web-based UI** — runs in background; access from the same device, another computer, or phone
- **Persistent settings** — saved to disk once per minute and on exit

#### Device Management
- **Auto-discovery** or manual add by IP address
- **Multiple devices** handled in parallel
- Should support all Twinkly devices (tested with 4 device types; RGB+W uses RGB only)

#### Effects
- **Real-time** (app must run) or **uploaded as a looping movie** to device hardware
- **Auto-rotate** effects with a custom interval (real-time mode only)
- **Rename, clone, reset, or delete** effects (built-in effects cannot be deleted)
- **Live LED preview** in the browser

#### Per-Device Settings
- Brightness, saturation, gamma correction, color temperature, RGB gain
- Mirror LEDs, adjust FPS

#### Per-Effect Settings
- **Speed** multiplier (separate from FPS)
- **Geometry** — mirror, 1D→2D mapping mode, 2D rotation, LEDs per pixel
- **Color correction** — gamma, invert
- **Movie config** — loop cycle count (some effects)

#### Palette & Color Options (many effects)
- **Color space** — Static (1 color), Multiple (n colors), Rainbow, Any
- **Order** — Round robin or random
- **Easing** — instant or smooth transitions between colors

## Download & Run

1. **Download** the latest release from [GitHub Releases](../../releases)
2. **Extract** the zip archive
3. **Run** `sparkly.exe`
4. **Open** your browser to **http://localhost:3001**

No installation or setup required — the executable is fully self-contained.

## Using Sparkly

### Adding Devices

When you first open Sparkly, head to the **Devices** page. You can add your Twinkly devices in two ways:

- **Auto-discover** — Click the discover button to scan your network for Twinkly devices
- **Manual add** — Enter the device's IP address directly

Devices are remembered between sessions automatically.

### Controlling Devices

Each device card on the Devices page lets you:

- **Set mode** — Switch between off, color, effect, and other device modes
- **Adjust brightness** — Slide to set brightness (0–100%)
- **Choose an effect** — Pick from the built-in effect library
- **Tune parameters** — Customize effect colors, speed, and other settings
- **Send movie** — Render an effect and upload it directly to the device hardware

### LED Preview

The web interface can mirror your device's LED state in real time. Two viewing modes are available:

- **Sequential** — LEDs shown in order, ideal for LED strips
- **2D mapped** — LEDs positioned using the device's 2D coordinate mapping

### Debug Page

The **Debug** page provides detailed device information and effect metadata — useful for troubleshooting connection issues.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                  | Solution                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Windows SmartScreen warning**          | Click **More info**, then click **Run anyway**                                              |
| **"Unknown Publisher" security warning** | Click **Run** to proceed                                                                    |
| **Can't find devices**                   | Make sure Twinkly devices are powered on and connected to the same network as your computer |
| **Port 3001 in use**                     | Close any other application using port 3001, then restart Sparkly                           |
| **Frontend won't load**                  | Try re-downloading the latest release                                                       |

## Requirements

- Windows (the executable is self-contained, no runtime needed)
- Twinkly LED devices on the same local network

# Developer Guide

Everything below is for contributors and developers working on the Sparkly source code.

## Architecture

Sparkly is a TypeScript monorepo (npm workspaces) with three packages:

| Package             | Description                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@sparkly/common`   | Shared API contract and types (Zod + ts-rest)             |
| `@sparkly/backend`  | Express backend — device communication, effects, REST API |
| `@sparkly/frontend` | SvelteKit frontend — web UI                               |

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for module boundaries and design decisions.
